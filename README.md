# SntsRatTool
China TurboHUD plugin + executable

## Features

- wiggle
- auto aim cast mages

## Requirements

- land of the dead on left click
- force move on space
- skeletal mages on right click

## How to use

- download exe and plugin
- create snts folder in plugin folder of lightning mod and copy SntsToolAdapter.cs into it
- restart lightning mod
- always start exe after lightning mod is started
- always close exe first before starting or restarting lightning mod
- !!important!! disable all wiggle and auto cast skeletal mages macros from other tools like godly or lightning mod intelligent macros

## Manual

- pressing force move or force stand still will stop wiggle temporarely
- mages will be refreshed when < 10 mages or remaining duration < 4 seconds

## Open Issues

- wiggle simulates left click -> standing on pylons while not using force move will click them
- spawning mages simulates right click -> might rightclick into chat or on portrait
